Given a collection of numbers.

Iterate through the collection one by one.
  - save the first value as the starting value.
  - for each iteration, compare the saved value with the current value.
  - if the current number is greater
    - reassign the saved value as the current value
  - otherwise, if the current value smaller or equal
    - move to the next value in the collection

After iterating through the collection, return the saved value.


keywords:

START	start of the program
SET	set a variable that we can use for later
GET	retrieve input from user
PRINT	display output to user
READ	retrieve a value from a variable
IF/ELSE IF/ELSE	show conditional branches in logic
